 * \brief AstCC: Asterisk Coin Controller Interface
 *
 * \author Naveen Albert <asterisk@phreaknet.org>
 */

/*
 * This is a boilerplate example of a simple AMI interface for
 * coin lines between Asterisk and a physical coin controller.
 *
 * Compilation Instructions:
 * This program needs to be statically compiled with CAMI.
 * The latest source for CAMI can be downloaded from: https://github.com/InterLinked1/cami
 * The following files are required (with this folder hierarchy):
 * - cami.c
 * - include/cami.h
 * - include/cami_actions.h
 * (simpleami.c and Makefile from CAMI are not needed)
 *
 * Your folder hierarchy should this look like this:
 * - include/cami.h (from CAMI)
 * - include/cami_actions.h (from CAMI)
 * - cami.c (from CAMI)
 * - astcc.c (from AstCC)
 * - Makefile (from AstCC)
 *
 * To compile, simply run "make".
 *
 * You will need to run the program under a user with permissions to access the serial port
 * or any other resources to which you may need access.
 * If the user has access to /etc/asterisk/manager.conf, you do not need to explicitly
 * specify the password as this program will read the config file and obtain it for you,
 * which is recommended over specifying it as an argument (IF the run user has access to that file).
 *
 * Program Dependencies:
 * - CAMI:    https://github.com/InterLinked1/cami
 * - Asterisk: res_coindetect module
 * - Asterisk manager.conf configuration:
 * -- Must have an AMI user with sufficient read/write permissions (call read/write).

/*! \todo
 * Complete these function stubs to work appropriately for your coin controller.
 * You can use C I/O functions to interact with a serial line, for example.
 * You will need to use the channel name (or device name) to find the appropriate
 * port if you have more than one coin phone you are controlling using this program.
 *
 * Return 0 on success and return -1 if a failure occurs and the operation
 * could not be completed.
